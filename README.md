This is a Python 2 script to create a decTitleKeys.bin file from a directory of CIA files. You should place the file in the same directory .txt file and run it with no arguments. It will then produce an decTitleKeys.bin file that can be checked and printed with [PlaiCDN](https://github.com/Plailect/PlaiCDN).

Your keys.txt file should have a titleid and titlekey on each line with a single space between them.

This script uses a couple lines from [@einstein95's](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-3ds_ctr_decryptor-void.370684/page-105#post-5245861) original script for supported getting the key of a single CIA at a time.
